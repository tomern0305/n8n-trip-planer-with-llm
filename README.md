## üó∫Ô∏è Flow Summary

### **Airtable Trigger**
Watches an Airtable table for new records (travel requests).  
Each request includes a **Location** and **User Email**.

---

### **Groq (Llama 3) AI Suggestion**
The workflow sends the *Location* and any extra user requests to Groq‚Äôs Llama 3 model.  
The AI returns three must-see attractions (**title**, **short description**, **coordinates** in string format).

---

### **Image Fetch via Unsplash**
For each attraction, a search is performed on Unsplash to get a relevant photo (1 per attraction).

---

### **Data Merging**
Merges the AI‚Äôs JSON results with their corresponding Unsplash image URLs.

---

### **HTML Page Generation**
Generates a modern, mobile-friendly HTML page that lists the suggested attractions with descriptions, images, and map links (Google, OSM, Waze).  
Includes an **Approve / Reject** button for user feedback.

---

### **Send Email to User**
The user receives the generated HTML page via email.

---

### **Approval & Feedback Flow**
